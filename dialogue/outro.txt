You stand victorious over the Skeleton King Nigel and his crazy dungeon, you take in a second to admire your grit and determination before grabbing as many gold coins as physically possible. While packing your pockets you notice a door marked “EXIT” and sigh in relief at the convenience.

You leave the dungeon with hundreds of thousands of dollars in gold. Nothing can stand in your way now, you’re insanely rich and the only question now is how to spend it. Thinking about it a brilliant idea pops into your mind. You quickly head to a “Gold2Cash” store and then to your bank to deposit your earnings. Getting home you hop onto your computer.

Your brilliant idea? You invest every single coin you earned into ethereum, smiling to yourself as you go to opensea and are barely able to purchase your first NFT Monkey! It may be disgustingly ugly, but it is yours and you love him very much.

Congratulations you have won! :D (but did you really?)
