You proceed to the next room,

Tall bookshelves line the walls with many multicolored books, you look at some of the titles…
“Nameless the Brave”
“The Adventures of Alex the Vast”
“Secrets of the Soulbreaker”
“Madi’s Mortuary Records”
As interesting as these titles look you are more alarmed by the cobwebs that cover almost all the books. Out of the corner of your eye, you notice that there are a group of books that are not covered in cobwebs. As soon as you notice them, they begin to violently shake!
