You proceed to the next room,

The only thing you can see in this room is five precariously placed candles, all of which are lit. A bit weird, you think to yourself, but as you get closer you see the candles are almost dead. You go to pick one up to bring with you, but as you step closer the floor illuminates in an eerie purple hue. A similarly colored smoke begins to pour out of the now illuminated circle in the room!
