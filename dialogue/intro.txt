You find yourself in the damp, dark corridor of a dungeon, following the narrow hallway you come to a giant stone door. On the frame of the stone door, in big bold letters is the word "WARNING." You weren't about to let some big, dumb letters get in between you and adventure though, so you proceed through the doors.

Walking through the door, you watch in shock as it closes behind you. You are now trapped, with only one way forward... through the dungeon.
